üöÄ Projects Showcase
Here is a list of the projects included in this repository. Each project is contained within its own directory.

üìÇ Project 1: [Your Project Name, e.g., Basic Calculator]
A brief one-or-two-sentence description of what this project does. For example: A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Concepts Demonstrated:

User Input/Output (cin, cout)

Conditional Logic (if-else, switch-case)

Basic Functions

Error Handling for invalid input

üìÇ Project 2: [Your Project Name, e.g., Simple Banking System]
A console-based application that simulates basic banking operations. Users can create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance.

Concepts Demonstrated:

Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects)

Encapsulation

Constructors and Methods

File I/O for data persistence (fstream)

üìÇ Project 3: [Your Project Name, e.g., Student Record Management]
A system to manage student records. It allows adding new students, searching for existing students, and displaying all records stored.

Concepts Demonstrated:

Structs or Classes for data modeling

Arrays or Vectors for data storage

Menu-driven interface

Looping and control structures

üõ†Ô∏è How to Compile & Run
Prerequisites
A C++ compiler, such as g++ (part of the GCC toolchain) or Clang.

Git for cloning the repository.

Steps
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/aminul01-g/CPP.git
cd CPP

Navigate to a specific project's directory:

cd "Project Name Here" 
# Example: cd "Basic Calculator"

Compile the source code:
Use your C++ compiler to create an executable file. The most common command using g++ is:

g++ main.cpp -o executable_name

(Replace main.cpp with the name of the main source file and executable_name with your desired output file name, e.g., calculator)

Run the compiled program:
Execute the file you just created.

On macOS or Linux:

./executable_name

On Windows:

executable_name.exe
